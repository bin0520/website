                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>While Tiandong County is well known for its mangoes, the
                        local government recognized the need to
                        evolve in the digital age. Embracing technology had
                        become urgent, prompting them to develop a
                        mobile application to promote their mango products and
                        expand their market reach‚Äîespecially among
                        younger generations.</p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>We conducted student and organizational research, created
                        a survey, earned IRB approval, recruited
                        participants, collected data, and analyzed the data
                        which quickly turned into actionable
                        recommendations to university leaders.</p>

                    <p>A user martix was established based on the pilot study

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>Based on the survey and interview results, we identified
                        the following issues:</p>

                        <li>Student health service was not responsive to

                            survey
                            of East Asian students, we successfully identified
                            key academic, social, and psychological
                            challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
                            qualitative responses provided rich insights
                            into students' emotional distress, feelings of
                            isolation, and experiences with anti-Asian

                            study. The analysis revealed patterns in student
                            needs, particularly around mental health support,
                            communication barriers, and the impact of

                            ensure data validity. Our team also improved
                            internal workflows for coding open-ended responses
                            and integrating results into policy briefs.

                            shared with

                            UAlbany, sparking interest in improving
                            campus communication and support services. Plans are
