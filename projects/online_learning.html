                    <p>Recognizing the needs of diverse students in online courses, I conducted an usability test on Guangxi Minzu University's online learning platform Canvas to give instructors the information they need to create a usable and accessible online course for all students.</p>

                        <p>As students moved online, it became increasingly important for instructors' course materials and designs in Canvas to be accessible and usable for all students. With so many diverse students who were struggling, it was clear that instructors needed to know their students' struggles to know how to revise their courses.</p>

                        <p>Based on the survey and interview results, we identified the following issues:</p>

                            <ul class="custom-list">
                                <li><strong>Deepened Understanding of Student Challenges.</strong> Through the mixed-methods survey of East Asian students, we successfully identified key academic, social, and psychological challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The qualitative responses provided rich insights into students' emotional distress, feelings of isolation, and experiences with anti-Asian sentiment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Collected Actionable Data to Inform Policy.</strong>We gathered data from over [insert number] participants across multiple institutions, achieving representation across different nationalities, education levels, and fields of study. The analysis revealed patterns in student needs, particularly around mental health support, communication barriers, and the impact of online learning environments.</li>
                                <li><strong>Strengthened Mixed-Methods Research Capacity.</strong>The project utilized both quantitative analysis (descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations) and qualitative coding, enhancing our ability to triangulate findings and ensure data validity. Our team also improved internal workflows for coding open-ended responses and integrating results into policy briefs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dissemination and Institutional Impact.</strong> Preliminary findings were shared with student affairs and international student offices at UAlbany, sparking interest in improving campus communication and support services. Plans are underway to present the results at a regional education conference and to publish a summary report accessible to stakeholders and peer institutions.</li>
                            </ul>
