                <span>I reprised this session in an 1.5-hour talk in which I
                    share surprising insights about what I’ve learned from helping over 55 patients visualize their
                    health history and symptoms. I discuss the unique types of data I collect and visualize – data that
                    isn’t found in our health records today – and I discuss how these visuals have helped clinicians and
                    patients alike.</span>

                    The culture of healthcare is built on
                    words: spoken, written, and typed words. But in many cases, words don’t work. They can’t efficiently
                    explain bodily sensations or lifetime journeys; they can’t sufficiently show emotions or trauma. As
                    a result, patients and doctors often don’t understand each other, and our broken healthcare system
                    bumbles along. We know there’s a better way. I collaborated on this session with the awesome Dr.
                    Anita Ravi, founder of the <span class="jox3_span4">PurpLE Health Foundation </span> and comic
                    artist.

                    I had the pleasure of speaking again
                    at the Medicine X CHANGE event in the fall of 2019. I shared case studies and insights from my work
                    helping patients visualize their health histories.

                    One major barrier to communication in doctor visits is that it’s hard to tell and understand complex
                    stories in rushed, 15-minute appointments. As a result many patients aren’t getting the right
                    diagnosis and treatment, and doctors are burning out. Visualizing data – both medical record data
                    and other key aspects of a patient’s story – can help patients and doctors communicate better and
                    work together more efficiently. In this talk I shared how health history timelines have helped me
                    and other patients collaborate better with our doctors, and I illustrated how visualizing our health
                    can revolutionize our healthcare system.
